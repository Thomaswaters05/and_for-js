# AND FOR EXERCISE- Practing Iteration

## Description
- Creates a for loop using a counter variable intialized at 5 and then incrementing by 10. The loop stops if the counter variable reaches a value greater than 120. Results will be in the console log/dev tools.(Increments by 10)
```
Example output:

Current value is 5

Current value is 15

Current value is 25

...

```
- Creates a for loop with a counter variable initialized at 4096. Each time the loop executes divide the counter variable by 2. The loop will stop once the counter variable reaches the value of 1. Results will be in the console log/dev tools. (Decrements by Division)
```
Example output:

Current value is 4096

Current value is 2048

Current value is 1024

...
```
- Creates an array that contains the names of American Presidents and uses a for loop along with string concatenation to output the order and name of each president-similar to the example below. Results will be in the console log/dev tools. (Array Iteration)
